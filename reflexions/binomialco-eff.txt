Binomial Co-efficients / Pascal Triangle

Recursive [ 2n function calls ]:
	For single query of nCk, small values of n
DP [ space O(k) ] :
	For single row of Pascal triangle
	Runs O(n*k) starts with empty array builds solution by overwriting
	To generate complete row (n = k)
DP [ space O(n*k) ] :
	For generates full Pascal triangle
	Runs O(n*k) starts with empty grid uses top/previous rows to compute bottom rows of triangle
